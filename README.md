## `What is GNL?` ðŸ¤”

The `GNL` (Get_next_line) is the first project with a higher level of difficulty both in technical aspects and in visualizing and understanding the process of creating it. At first, we have two ways to code it: `Linked list` or with `arrays`.
<br>

`I chose` to use the `linked list`, seeing as I love learning new concepts and this new `data structure` seemed very fun. So, I decided to start by studying about linked lists, and a great start was to follow the videos from the `CodeVault` channel:

<br>

	</a>
</p>

<br>

But to summarize, a `linked list` is a sequence of `elements`, where each element is connected to the next one by a `pointer`. Unlike `arrays`, the elements are not placed contiguously in memory, which allows for efficient `insertions` and `deletions` as it doesn't require shifting elements around. Each element, known as a `node`, contains the `data` and a reference (or a `link`) to the next node in the sequence, making the structure `flexible` and `dynamic`.

# `Mandatory part` ðŸ“‘

The mandatory part of the project states that the `Get_next_line()` function must read a line from a file descriptor. What does this mean? It means we must read up to the `'\n'`. And what if there is no `'\n'`? Then we must read until the end of the file, i.e., until `'\0'`. If something goes wrong, we return `NULL`. Sounds quite straightforward, doesn't it?

## Important notes:

- The `GNL` function must be prototyped as follows: `char *get_next_line(int fd);`

- The `return` value is a `line` that has been `read` ( `NULL` if there is nothing else to read, or an `error` occurred ).

- The function returns its result without `'\n'` if there is one.

- External functions allowed: `read`, `malloc`, `free`.

- The `GNL` function must be able to compile the `BUFFER_SIZE` value directly on the command line with `-D BUFFER_SIZE=\<value>`

- But, it should also run `without` a BUFFER_SIZE defined on the command line

- Remember that your program must `compile` with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`

- You must only `deliver` the following files to your repository: `get_next_line.c`, `get_next_line_utils.c`, `get_next_line.h`
